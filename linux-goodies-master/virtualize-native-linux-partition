Assuming VMVare like a virtualization engine (In Virtual Box the procedure is little bit different)

On Terminal type:
cd /Applications/VMware\ Fusion.app/Contents/Library/
./vmware-rawdiskCreator print /dev/disk0

In my case Nr.6 is GPT EE Linux FS, so:
./vmware-rawdiskCreator create /dev/disk0 6 ~/Documents/Virtual\ Machines.localized/Virtual\ Disk ide

In VM create a custom virtual machine, select Linux Ubuntu 64bit, Fedora 64bit or your fav distro and create a new virtual disk
Open Open Virtual Machines folder and copy  Virtual Disk.vmdk and Virtual Disk-pt.vmdk
On Fusion Machine Package, trash all the .vmdk files and past the newly created

Open Ubuntu 64-bit.vmx (or similar for other distros) with a text editor
Delete entries that start with ‘scsi0:0’ (do not delete ‘scsi0.’ only ‘scsi0:0′)
Add the following:
ide0:0.present = "TRUE"
ide0:0.fileName = "Virtual Disk.vmdk"
ide0:0.deviceType = "rawDisk"
suspend.disabled = "TRUE"

On settings of VM, enable the CD/DVD Drive and set to load the follow iso file:
http://forja.cenatic.es/frs/download.php/file/1757/super_grub2_disk_hybrid_2.00s2.iso

Start your VM, press F2 to enter bios setup 
On Boot tab, reorder the boot list entries like this:
CD-ROM drive > Removable Devices > Hard Drive > Network boot

Exit and save

Run and enjoy your linux native partition virtualized inside what you want!
